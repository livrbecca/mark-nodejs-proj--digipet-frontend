We're going to building a frontend to connect to our Digipet backend, so it's possible to interact with our digipet through a nice user interface!

## Learning Outcomes

- Connect a locally running frontend to a locally running backend

> 🏋🏾‍♀️ **Stretch challenge: building your own frontend from scratch.** This repo has a scaffold for an existing frontend, to be used as a basis to plug into your Digipet backend. You are, however, free to disregard this and build out your own frontend for your digipet backend entirely from scratch.

## Exercise 0: Running and connecting to the backend

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** you can run the frontend locally and connect it to your digipet backend

### Connecting to the backend

Make sure that you've shut down your backend server.

Then, clone/fork the repo and start your frontend app with `yarn start`.

It will start on `localhost:3000` - but it won't do anything interesting, really, but it will warn you about a `TypeError: Failed to fetch`.

If you [open up your browser console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open), you'll also see something like the following:

```
GET http://localhost:4000/digipet net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

So, our `fetch` is running into an error. It can't connect to `localhost:4000/digipet` - because our backend server isn't running!

So, start up your backend server. You now should be able to hatch and walk a digipet through your server!

### Persistence through the server

React apps lose their state when you refresh them in the browser. However, when you refresh `localhost:3000`, you'll see that the stats of our digipet are preserved - because this data is stored in-memory in the server!

When the server is restarted, it'll lose its state, and so everything will be lost (**try this and see**) - but that's still an improvement! In a later project, we'll look at adding some basic persistence to our server.

## Exercise 1: Reading, understanding and documenting

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** a document which outlines how you think this React frontend interacts with the Express backend. You don't have to achieve a theory which explains 100%, but you should strive to explain as much as possible.

## Exercise 2: Extending the frontend behaviour

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** a frontend app which lets you interact with the digipet backend at all sensible endpoints.

Our React app facilitates very limited interaction with our backend at the moment - we ended up adding functionality on training, feeding and ignoring our digipet in the last exercise.

Make the game more complete by adding in the frontend UI to support the full suite of behaviour which the backend supports.

### Optional: changing the server responses

As you're doing this, you may wish to change some of the endpoint response behaviour.

For example, some of the server responses refer to endpoints like `/digipet/hatch` in their body `message` - which may be helpful to a developer trying to navigate the server endpoints, but which is meaningless to a typical user of our frontend (who doesn't know, and doesn't need to know, about these endpoints).

Some strategies here might include:

1. Re-specifying the request handlers (and associated tests) to omit mention of endpoints
2. Adding in a new body property, e.g. `description`, to separate out "message for developer consuming this API" and "message for the frontend to show in the UI"

## Exercise 3: Styling / refactoring (optional)

The frontend is quite plain and boring - you may wish to style it (CSS Modules, `styled-components`, external component libraries...).

We think this is a worthwhile exercise, to keep that muscle fresh and have a full-stack experience of CSS through to React through to NodeJS, but we suggest you timebox this to a _maximum_ of one hour.

## Exercise 4: Commentary and reflection

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** documented reflections.
